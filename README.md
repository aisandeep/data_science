There are three sections in this project.
1. page1.py is a streamlit page(website), which is used to collect the information from the companies, who are interested in our projects.

2. page2.py is a streamlit page, which is used to collect the information from the candidates, especially for the data scientists hiring.

3. page3.py is a another streamlit page, and it is a visualization dashboard for all the data in the supabase database.

4. The data taken or shown in the streamlit pages are imported from the supabase database, and some files are stored in the AWS s3.
